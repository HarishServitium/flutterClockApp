# Flutter Clock Application
--------------------------------------------------<br>
Time is the most valuable thing a person can spend.<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
In this awesome project I did all the heavy works like:<br>
1. Use of BLoC for State Management<br>
2. Use of Flutter Local Notification<br>
3. Use of Internationalization or Localization<br>
4. Use of Local Database (SQflite Package)<br>
5. Use of Flutter CustomPainter (Canvas)<br>

Here is the Clock Page View:<br>
<br>

To draw the clock, I used Flutter CustomPainter Class.<br>
In the bottom left corner, We can change the language of the application.<br>
Now, Only Bangla, English and Hindi languages are available.<br>
We can switch to the other views by using the left side menu options.<br>
Here I have implemented the BLoC State Management to control these events.<br>
<br>
Here is the Alarm Page View:<br>
<br>

To store all the alarms I used Flutter Local Database Library (SQflite).<br>
And for the notification, I used Flutter Local Notification Library.<br>
Till Now, These are the features I am working with.<br>
InShaaAllah, I will finish this project very soon.<br>
Thanks for your time.<br>
